===================

This repo contains two **FreeCodeCamp** projects --- [Stock Market](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/chart-the-stock-market) and [Night Life](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app).

The app can be accessed [here](http://peaceful-tor-73822.herokuapp.com).

The data is all stored in [mLab](https://mlab.com).

>**Note**
>Stock Market uses [Markit API](http://dev.markitondemand.com/) to retrieve market data, and uses [HightCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) to render stock charts.
>For Night Life app, the default user is `admin`, and the password is `admin`
>Night Life app uses [Baidu Place API](http://api.map.baidu.com/lbsapi/cloud/webservice-placeapi.htm), so Chinese characters are recommended when searching for places to go.
>And [passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) is used to implement user log in and user session.
