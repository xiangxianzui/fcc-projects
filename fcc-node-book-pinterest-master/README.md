# fcc-node-book-pinterest
===================

This repo contains two **FreeCodeCamp** projects --- [Manage a Book Trading Club](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club) and [Build a Pinterest Clone](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pinterest-clone).

### Online version

This project has been deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and data is stored in [mLab](https://mlab.com)

The app can be accessed [here](https://blooming-mountain-66425.herokuapp.com).

>**Note**
>Since Heroku runs app on an [Ephemeral filesystem](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem), local storage will be lost when the app restart. This is annoying because all images uploaded will be vanished after several hours. I am currently looking for some alternatives to host my uploaded images.

### Run it locally

>**Note**
>Git, Node.JS, npm, MongoDB should be intalled first

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/xiangxianzui/fcc-node-book-pinterest.git
$ cd fcc-node-book-pinterest
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```
